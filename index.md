# I'm Rishi Rahul
Hi there, I'm an accomplished professional with a diverse background in engineering and extensive industry experience. I hold a B.Tech in Instrumentation Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, followed by an M.Tech in the same field. My journey into the realm of engineering began with two years of enriching experience in embedded systems design at Bosch, where I honed my skills in developing cutting-edge solutions. Subsequently, I ventured into Electronic Design Automation (EDA) at Synopsis, where I further expanded my expertise over three years, contributing to innovative projects and pushing the boundaries of technology. My passion for engineering and dedication to excellence drive me to continually seek new challenges and deliver impactful solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
