### I'm Rishi Rahul

In 2023, I founded Blitzfill Technologies with the goal of collaborating with researchers and developers to solve intriguing problems and create open-source solutions. 

Currently, I serve as the Head of Technology at Thinkbot Research, a leading high-frequency trading firm. My achievements include creating a high-frequency trading platform and stock market simulator for Thinkbot Research, where I oversee its ongoing maintenance and enhancement, organize and manage the technology team, spearhead the development of new technologies to support quantitative research, and promote best practices in software development within the organization. For more insights into my professional journey, feel free to visit my webpage. 

My professional passions include optimizing software performance, engaging in scientific computing, and exploring software design, development, and quant research. Outside of work, I'm an avid marathon runner and enjoy cycling in my leisure time.
